# Activity: Fetching and Modifying JSONPlaceholder User Data

In this activity, you will learn how to fetch user data from the JSONPlaceholder API, store it in a variable, and create modified objects for each user with specific fields using JavaScript.

## Steps

### Step 1: Write a Function to fetch data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`

1. Write a JavaScript function (e.g., `fetchUserData`) that performs the following tasks:

### Step 2: Store Data

1. Inside the `fetchUserData` function, store the fetched user data in a variable (e.g., `users`).

### Step 3: Modify Data

1. Still within the `fetchUserData` function, create modified user objects for each user with specific fields as follows:

   - Name
   - Username
   - Email
   - Address (Street name only)
   - Phone
   - Website
   - Company (Company name only)

and put these new objects in an array.

### Step 4: Display Data

1. Finally, within the `fetchUserData` function, display the modified user data in the console using `console.log()`.
